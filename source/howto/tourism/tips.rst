Quick and (not-so) Dirty Tips for Tourism (AKA Mini-howtos)
-----------------------------------------------------------

This section contains various tips and tricks to improve and tweak the
queries sent to the Tourism datasets, allowing more precise results to
be retrieved. This page is divided into two parts: The first one shows
examples with code (usually the API call), the second is organised
like a FAQ section.


Example Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _tour-ex1:

.. rubric:: EX1. Why does this query return no result?


:apit:`Gastronomy?pagesize=3&categorycodefilter=0&locfilter=reg268`

Because there is no value :strong:`reg268` for `locfilter`. You can
return valid IDs to be used as locfilter using this call:

:apit:`RegionReduced?language=it`

An example result for this call is:

.. code:: json

   {
     "Id": "D2633A26C24E11D18F1B006097B8970B",
     "Name": "Alta Badia"
   }

Therefore, use the ID :strong:`regD2633A26C24E11D18F1B006097B8970B` in
`locfilter` to search for Gastronomy in the Alta Badia region.

.. _tour-ex2:

.. rubric:: EX2. The locfilter parameter.

|q| How do I correctly use the `locfilter` parameter?

.. code::

   locfilter =>
   Locfilter (Separator ',' possible values: reg + REGIONID = (Filter by
   Region), reg + REGIONID = (Filter by Region), tvs + TOURISMVEREINID =
   (Filter by Tourismverein), mun + MUNICIPALITYID = (Filter by
   Municipality), fra + FRACTIONID = (Filter by Fraction)),
   (default:'null')

It seems to accept a string, but how is this string built?

|a| `locfilter` accepts a string composed as follows: a region
identifier, followed immediately by a location Identifier.

Location identifier are the following four:

* :strong:`reg`: Region (Italian Regione)
* :strong:`tvs`: Turistic association (German Tourismusverein)
* :strong:`mun`: Municipality, i.e., town or city (Italian Municipalità)
* :strong:`fra`: Suburb or district (Italian frazione)

IDs for each location can be gathered either from the swagger
interface or using an API calls:

* :strong:`reg`:

     http://tourism.opendatahub.com/swagger/ui/index#!/Common/Common_GetRegionsReduced
     :apit:`RegionReduced?language=it`

* :strong:`tvs`:

    http://tourism.opendatahub.com/swagger/ui/index#!/Common/Common_GetTourismvereinReduced
    :apit:`TourismAssociationReduced?language=iturismusverein)`

* :strong:`mun`:

    http://tourism.opendatahub.com/swagger/ui/index#!/Common/Common_GetMunicipalityReduced
    :apit:`MunicipalityReduced?language=it`

* :strong:`fra`:

    http://tourism.opendatahub.com/swagger/ui/index#!/Common/Common_GetDistrictReduced
    :apit:`DistrictReduced?language=it`

For example, to retrieve all Gastronomy in the suburb of Lana, first
retrieve its ID, which is:

.. code:: json

      {
        "Id": "79CBD79551C911D18F1400A02427D15E",
        "Name": "Lana"
      }

Then pass the string :strong:`fra79CBD79551C911D18F1400A02427D15E` as
`locfilter`:

  :apit:`Gastronomy?locfilter=fra79CBD79551C911D18F1400A02427D15E`

.. _tour-ex3:

.. rubric:: EX3. The `categorycodefilter` parameter.

|q| `categorycodefilter` seems similar to the `locfilter`
parameter found in :ref:`this trick <tour-ex2>`, but this does not
accept string?

.. code::

   Category Code Filter (BITMASK values: 1 = (Restaurant), 2 = (Bar /
   Café / Bistro), 4 = (Pub / Disco), 8 = (Apres Ski), 16 =
   (Jausenstation), 32 = (Pizzeria), 64 = (Bäuerlicher Schankbetrieb),
   128 = (Buschenschank), 256 = (Hofschank), 512 = (Törggele Lokale),
   1024 = (Schnellimbiss), 2048 = (Mensa), 4096 = (Vinothek /Weinhaus /
   Taverne), 8192 = (Eisdiele), 16348 = (Gasthaus), 32768 = (Gasthof),
   65536 = (Braugarten), 131072 = (Schutzhütte), 262144 = (Alm), 524288 =
   (Skihütte)

The `categorycodefilter` parameter accepts integers instead of
strings, in :ref:`bitmask-value <bitmask-value>`. The code of each
category is a power of 2, so to search in multiple categories, simply
:strong:`add` the respective codes and pass them as value of the
parameter. For example, to search for Restaurants (1) and Pizzerias
(32), pass :strong:`33` to `categorycodefilter`:

  :apit:`Gastronomy?categorycodefilter=33`

Tips and Tricks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _tour-tt1:

.. rubric:: TT1. Categorycodefilter in the Accomodation dataset.

|q| In the Accommodation dataset there's no `categorycodefilter`
filter, like in the Gastronomy dataset. Is there some equivalent
filter?

|a| In the Accommodations dataset use :strong:`categoryfilter` instead.

*****

.. _tour-tt2:

.. rubric:: TT2. `odhactive` and filters starting with `odh`.

|q| What is the purpose of the `odhactive` filter? And what do all the
filters prefixed with :strong:`odh` stand for?

.. _odhtags:

|a| In the datasets, there are filters like `active` and `odhactive`,
where `odh` simply stands for |odh|. Filters starting with
:strong:`odh` are collectively called :term:`ODHtags`.

Datasets filtered with the former return all data sent by
the dataset provider, while the latter returns those validated by the
|odh| team as well. This parameter is useful in a number of use
cases. Suppose that the |odh| team receives a dataset contains name
and location of ski lifts within South Tyrol's ski areas. If the
dataset has not been updated in a few years, some entry in that
dataset might be non valid anymore, for example a ski lift has been
replaced by a cable car or has been dismantled. If this case has been
verified by the |odh| team, the entry referring to that ski lift will
not appear in the |odh|\.


.. _tour-tt3:

.. rubric:: TT3. The `seed` filter

|q| What is the `seed` filter used for?

|a| `seed` is used in pagination, i.e., when there are two or more
pages of results, to keep the sorting across all pages. When
retrieving a high number of items in a dataset it is desirable to have
only a limited amount of results in each page.

It is possible to activate seed in two ways: in the dataset, choose a
:monospace:`pagenumber` (the number of the result page that will be
shown first) or a :monospace:`pagesize` (number of items in each page,
we'll use :strong:`15` in this example) and set :monospace:`seed` to
:strong:`0`.  At the beginning of query's :strong:`Response Body` you
will see something like:

.. parsed-literal::

   {
  "TotalResults": 10564,
  "TotalPages": 705,
  "CurrentPage": 1,
  "OnlineResults": -1,
  "Seed": "43",
  "Items": [
    {

The remainder of the :strong:`Response Body` contains the first 15
sorted items. If you now want to retrieve page 2, page 56, or any
other, use :strong:`43` as :monospace:`seed` and write :strong:`2`,
:strong:`56`, or the desired value as :monospace:`pagenumber`.

If you do not enter the :strong:`seed`, you could find an item that
was already shown before, because the API can not guarantee that the
same sorting is used in different queries.

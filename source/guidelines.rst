============================
Documentation for Developers
============================

This section contained a lot of documentation that developers had to
adhere to when collaborating with the Open Data Hub:

* Coding conventions including programming languages and technologies
  used, development and deployment workflows, and more

* Design of databases, their use, access to tables and data, and more

* Relation between Open Data Hub's core development team and external
  collaborators

* Authentication

As the development team grew, most of these guideline changed, some
technologies have been obsoleted and new ones were
introduced. Additionally, the number of repositories managed for the
Open Data Hub Project has increased considerably, and many of them
have specific guidelines for developers.

Therefore, to simplify access to information relevant to developers,
all the content that was featured in this section has been moved and
rearranged. The repository
https://github.com/noi-techpark/documentation contains a `README.md
<https://github.com/noi-techpark/documentation/blob/main/README.md>`_
file with all information that allows a new collaborator to be
productive in a short time.

Then, depending on which part of the Open Data Hub Project you are
going to collaborate, have a look at the :file:`README.md` files in
the various repositories.

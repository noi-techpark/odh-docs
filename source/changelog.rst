.. versionadded:: 2021.03 Add extension to provide structured
   Changelogs

This section contains the Changelog of the |odh| project's
documentation.

* Previous to June 2020, we maintained no changelog.
* The list of changes made from June, 2020 to February, 2021 can be
  :download:`downloaded <changelog.txt>` as a text file.

* Since March 2021 we adopted a more structured approach: This section
  indeed will contain an entry for each change made to the
  documentation.

.. note:: We do not schedule regular releases of the documentation, we
	rather publish new versions `"When they are ready"`, therefore each
	`version` is identified by a string :strong:`YYYY.MM`, in which
	`YYYY` is the year and `MM` the month of the release.

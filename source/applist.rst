Apps Built From Open Data Hub Datasets
======================================

This section features a list of applications--and their
descriptions--built using the :doc:`datasets` that the Open Data Hub team
makes available.

Applications are grouped according to their status in three categories:

* Production status. These applications are already used in production
  environment.
* Development status, aka `beta stage`, shown by the |beta|
  badge. Application in beta stage are developed actively and might
  already be suitable for a production environment.
* Experimental status, aka `alpha stage`, shown by the |alpha|
  badge. Applications falling in this category are in the early stage
  of development, and might be for example, a proof of concept or the
  outcome of a hackathon. They might not be maintained or developed
  further and should not be considered mature enough to be deployed in
  a production environment.

If you are developing one application with the data provided by
datasets of the Open Data Hub project, send an email with a short description,
an email contact and its status and we'll add it to the list.

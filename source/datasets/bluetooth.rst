The data for this datasets are collected by experimental
Bluetooth-based sensors and detectors currently located on various
points of the streets of Bolzano and soon in other location of South
Tyrol. Gathered data are then processed to obtain useful information
about the traffic; therefore, data in this dataset are:

* The total number of vehicles detected
* An estimation of heavy and light vehicles

Collected data are also split within intervals (of e.g.,15, 30
minutes), for statistical and historical offline analysis. Moreover,
the data gathered by the Bluetooth devices are used in the
:ref:`linkstation-dataset`.

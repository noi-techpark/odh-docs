      This dataset contains a collection of activities and Points of
      Interest (:strong:`PoI`) in the South Tyrol region. The available
      data have been extracted from different sources and also offer IDM
      categorisation. This is a kind of `superdataset`, which includes
      also  :ref:`poi dataset <poi-dataset>`, :ref:`activity dataset
      <activity-dataset>`, and :ref:`gastronomy dataset
      <gastronomy-dataset>`.

      .. but at the moment only the data about the South Tyrolean museums
         and wines are freely available without authentication. These
         data can be obtained by using the keywords :strong:`MuseumData`
         and :Strong:`SuedtirolWein` in the `source` filter of the
         dataset.

      The :strong:`VMS` (Variable Message Sign) sensors collect data
      about the electronic road signs on the A22 Motorway.

      This dataset is formally part of the :ref:`traffic station dataset
      <trafficstation-dataset>`, but since data are specific to VMS, we
      split them for clarity.

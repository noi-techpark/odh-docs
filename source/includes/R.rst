`R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_ is a free software for statistical
analysis that creates also graphics from the gathered data.

The Open Data Hub Team has developed and made available `bzar
<https://github.com/noi-techpark/it.bz.opendatahub.analytics.libs/tree/main/api/R>`_,
an R package that can be used to access `BZ Analytics
<https://analytics.opendatahub.com/>`_ data (see also
:ref:`bz-analytics`) and process them using all the R
capabilities. Download and installation instructions, along with
example usage can be found on the `bzar repository
<https://github.com/noi-techpark/it.bz.opendatahub.analytics.libs/tree/main/api/R>`_.

.. seealso:: There is a howto that explains how to fetch data from the
   |odh| datasets using R and SPARQL: :ref:`howto-r`.

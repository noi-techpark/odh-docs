A :term:`Domain` is a category that contains entities that are closely
related. In the |odh|, each domain roughly identifies one social or
economical category; the domains intended as sources for data served
by the |odh| are depicted at the bottom of :numref:`domains-diagram`.

Currently, the domains that can be accessed through the |odh| are:

#. :ref:`Mobility <mobility-datasets>`, this domain contains data
   about public transportation, parkings, charging station, and so on.
#. :ref:`Tourism <tourism-datasets>`: data about events,
   accomodations, points of interest, and so on.
#. :ref:`Other <other-domains-datasets>` domain: a special category that encompasses domains
   that do not fall in any of the above category.

Each domain is composed by datasets, each of which contains data
that provide useful information for the domain.

It is important to note that there is no clear separation between two
domains. For example, data about public transportation belong to the
Mobility domain, but are also useful for the Tourism domain.

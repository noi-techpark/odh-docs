...harvest data exposed by the dataset.
   Browse the list of :ref:`available_datasets` to see what types of
   data are contained in the datasets, and think how they can be used.

   For this purpose, we maintain an updated list of the
   :ref:`available datasets <available_datasets>` with links to the
   API to access them.

...build an application with the data.
   Write code for an app that combines the data you can harvest from
   the available datasets in various, novel way.

   To reach this goal, you need to access the APIs, their
   documentation, and the datasets. It is then your task to discover
   how you can reuse the data in your code.

...integrate Open Data Hub data using Web Components.
   The Open Data Hub team and their partner have developed a `small library of
   Web Components <https://webcomponents.opendatahub.com/>`_ that can
   be integrated in existing web sites or used as guidance to develop
   new Web Components.

...publish my app in Open Data Hub.
   As soon as you have developed a stable version of your app, get in
   touch with us: We plan to maintain an updated list of apps based on
   our dataset included with this documentation.


No software installation is needed: Go to the list of :ref:`available
applications developed by third-parties <applist>` that use Open Data Hub
data, to the API documentation of each :ref:`Dataset
<available_datasets>` and start from there, and develop in a language
of your choice an application that uses our data.

...help shape the future of Open Data Hub.
   Participate in the development of Open Data Hub: Build new data
   collectors, extend the functionality of the broker, integrate new
   datasets on the existing infrastructure, develop new stable API
   versions.   

   
To be able to become a core hacker, however, requires a few additional
tasks to be carried out:


#. Learn how to successfully integrate your code with the existing
   code-base and how to interact with the Open Data Hub team.  In
   other words, you need to check the `Developer's Flight Rules
   <https://github.com/noi-techpark/documentation/blob/main/README.md>`_

#. Understand the :ref:`architecture-odh`.
#. Install the necessary software on your local workstation (be it a
   physical workstation, a virtual machine, or a Docker instance),
   including PostgreSQL with postgis extension, JDK, git.
#. Set up all the services needed (database, application server, and
   so on).
#. Clone our git repositories.  To successfully complete these tasks,
   please read the :ref:`development` tutorial, which guides you
   stepwise through all the required set up and configuration, along
   with some troubleshooting advice.


#. Coding. That's the funniest part, enjoy!

To support the installation tasks and ease the set up of your
workstation, we are developing a script the you will do the job for
you. Stay tuned for updates.

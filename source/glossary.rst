   API  
      The Application Programming Interface is a collection of methods
      that a software program makes available to allow interaction
      with other programs. 
   
   Domain
      A domain is a category of interest to which one or more datasets
      belong to.

   Dataset
      A dataset is a collection of records from a Data source. 

   Data Format
      Data format is the way information is encoded and exchanged between
      applications.

   Endpoint
      An Endpoint is an online resource that make data available,
      usually through REST APIs.
      
   JSON
      The JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data format to
      ease the exchange of data between computer and its understanding
      for humans. Essentially a JSON file is a sequence of key-value
      pairs, organised into lists (arrays, sequences,
      vectors). Nesting of key-values and of lists is supported.

   CSV
      CSV stands for Comma Separated Value, and is a file in which
      the content is organised in a fixed number of fields per line,
      separated by a comma (,) or some other symbol, like a semi-colon,
      a slash, or a vertical bar.

   Key-value
      Also called name-value pair or attribute-name pair, a key-value
      pair is a simple data structure in which information are stored
      as tuples {attribute, value}, with no constraint of uniqueness
      on both attribute and value.
     
   Data Provider  
      A Data Provider is an entity that supplies data or datasets to
      the |odh|. See :ref:`detailed description <data-providers>`.
   
   Claim
     In JSON Web Token, a claim is a piece of information about a
     subject, structured as a key/value pair.


   JSON Web Token
     It is a mechanism to exchange a claim between two parties, used
     for authentication purposes when the claim is digitally signed
     and/or encrypted.

   Statistical Graphics   
     Statistical graphics are means to display statistical data with
     the purpose to ease their interpretations. Common statistical
     graphics include pie charts, histograms, and scatter plot.

   ODHtags
     In the tourism domain, this name refers to all the tags/filter
     that refer to data that have been validated by the Open Data Hub
     team.

   Sensor
     Within the |odh|\, a sensor is intended as a kind of `device`
     that gathers data and sends them to another device which stores
     them in a machine-readable format, used to exchange or publish
     them. Depending on the domain a sensor may collect environmental
     data in the mobility domain (like, e.g., temperature, humidity,
     pressure), but in the tourism domain a `sensor` can collect
     the guests in a hotel or the people attending at an event. In
     these cases, the `device` is usually a human (e.g., the hotel's
     receptionist and the organiser of the event), and the data are
     digitalised manually.

   REST API
   RESTful API
     A REST(ful) API is a Web Service that adheres the architectural
     constraint of a `RESTful system
     <https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/>`_. It is
     composed of a URI, a collection of methods to interact with the
     resources offered by the Web Service, and a media type defining
     the accepted data formats.

   Web Component
     A Web Component is a set of API that allows the creation of
     interoperable HTML widgets that can be shared and reused.

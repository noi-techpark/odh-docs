This section helps you in getting quickly in touch with the most
popular tools developed by |odh| to interact with the dataset and
the whole ecosystem.

At the time of writing, all tools are available online: they are
summarised in the following table.

      Databrowser
      ^^^^^

      Access the `ODH Tourism data browser
      <https://databrowser.opendatahub.bz.it/>`_ and search for the
      Open Data available in the Tourism domain. You can simply use
      those data for your convenience, or you might even find a novel
      way to exploit those data and use them in an app or portal you
      are going to develop. A detailed howto is available:
      :ref:`tourism-data-browser-howto` to help you getting acquainted
      with the browser.

      Analytics tools
      ^^^^^

      Open the :strong:`Analytics for Mobility` web page, at
      https://analytics.opendatahub.bz.it/ This portal uses data in
      the mobility domain to display various information about the
      sensors, including their locations, what they measure, and
      actual data in near-real time. You can retrieve data gathered by
      the sensors directly from the dataset, in almost real-time.

      Swagger API interface
      ^^^^^

      Go to the :strong:`Swagger interface` of the datasets in the
      Tourism domain, located at
      https://tourism.opendatahub.bz.it/swagger/ui/index to learn how
      the REST APIs are built and how you can script them to fetch
      data for your application. To get started, there is a dedicated
      howto: :ref:`tourism-data-howto` that will guide you in the
      first steps.

      Access the :strong:`Swagger interface` of the datasets in the
      Mobility domain, located at
      https://mobility.api.opendatahub.bz.it/. Like in the case of the
      tourism' Swagger interface, you can learn REST API call for that
      domain and fetch data for your application. More possibilities
      to interact with the Mobility domain datasets and the
      description of the new APIv2 are described in the
      :ref:`dedicated howto <get-started-mobility>`.

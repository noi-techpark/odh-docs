|ODH| Architecture
==================

.. versionchanged:: 2023-09 replace obsolete architecture description

The architecture of the |odh| has grown over time from a software that
could be run on (almost) anyone's box with little requirements to a
fully fledged infrastructure built on `Kubernetes
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/>`_, its package manager, `Helm
<https://helm.sh/docs/>`_, and `Terraform
<https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform>`_. Dozen of software have
been packed together to create a platform that is able to scale up
quickly and easily, and it is continuously evolving.

It has therefore become difficult to keep the description of the
architecture updated, because it has become rather technical.  For
these reasons, and to allow developers to remain updated on the
evolution of the |odh| ecosystem, a dedicated repository has been
created, that contains the full information and is updated constantly.

The repository is available at https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-infrastructure-v2

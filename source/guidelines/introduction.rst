Guidelines for Developers
=========================

   versions

|odh| is a collection of software, databases, and services coordinated
and hosted by `NOI techpark <https://noi.bz.it/en>`_ in Bolzano/Bozen,
South Tyrol. Currently, |odh| systems are related to mobility and
tourism. In the future |odh| might diversify into more fields.

Companies and developers contributing to |odh| must follow the
guidelines listed in the documents as close as possible.

The aim of the |odh| Developer's Guidelines (:strong:`"The
Guidelines"`) is to simplify the hosting and maintenance of the
software, databases, and services by the |odh| developers and
maintainers at NOI Techpark ("the |odh| team").

The Guidelines describe the conventions to which a developer must
adhere, to be able to become an active |odh| developer or to see his
work being incorporated into the |odh|\. They are split in two parts:

* :strong:`Platform Guidelines` explain the preferred programming
  languages, how to expose the data after you manipulated them, the
  use of third-party libraries or plugins, and so on.
* :strong:`Database Guidelines` clarify how to design a database that
  shall become part of the |odh| platform.

Both of can be found in summary and in full version in the pages
:ref:`platform-guidelines` and :ref:`db-guidelines` respectively
